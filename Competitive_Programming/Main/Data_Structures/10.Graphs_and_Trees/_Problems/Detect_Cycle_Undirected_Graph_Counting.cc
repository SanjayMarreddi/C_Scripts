/*
This works only for UNDIRECTED Graphs. Even in some Undirected Graphs, It is failing. Debug it!
For Directed graphs, We need to talk in terms of STRONG CONNECTIVITY instead of CONNECTIVITY.
Another way to find out whether a graph contains a cycle is to simply calculate
the number of nodes and edges in every component. If a component contains c
nodes and no cycle, it must contain exactly c âˆ’1 edges (so it has to be a tree). If
there are c or more edges, the component surely contains a cycle.

Example Test case where it fails for directed graph:
7
1 3 2 -1
2 4 -1
3 5 -1
4 5 7 -1
5 6 -1
6 -1
7 -1
